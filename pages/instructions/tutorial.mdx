## 1. Tutorial: Build and Improve Counter
This tutorial will demonstrate how to use ReactGenie to build a simple Counter app. You don't need to write code in this part, just follow the
instructions to understand how to use ReactGenie to build a multimodal app.

### 1.1 ReactGenie Overview
We'll start with a brief introduction to the ReactGenie framework to help you understand how to build multimodal applications using ReactGenie.

ReactGenie is a framework help developers to build a multimodal app.
<font color="#8b0000">ReactGenie will automatically parse users' natural language queries to function calls based on LLM, execute the command and then display
 the result.</font> As developers, you only need to give some descriptions and examples to help ReactGenie handle user's query.

Each multimodal app built with ReactGenie consists of three parts:

1. **State Code**: This is used to control and manage the state, such as data and executing functions. 
It is written in the <font color="red">`genie`</font> folder.

2. **UI Code**: This is used to display the state data and allow users to interact with the data via the UI.
It is written in the <font color="red">`src`</font> folder.

3. **Link UI to State code**: This involves linking the State to UI so ReactGenie knows using which UI to render which type of results.
You will need to modify <font color="red">`App.tsx`</font> and <font color="red">`store.ts`</font>.

For example, in the upcoming Counter app tutorial, the state code includes the Counter class (<font color="red">`Counter.ts`</font>) for counter state management,
and the UI code includes views of the counter input form and the interface for added counters (e.g., <font color="red">`EditCounterView.tsx`</font>).
The structure of the Counter app is as follows:

 ```bash {3,6,7,8,9}
- genie
    - //state code
    - Counter.ts
- src
    - //UI code
    - EditCounterView.tsx
    - CounterItemView.tsx
    - CounterListView.tsx
    - MainView.tsx
-App.tsx
-store.ts
```

We'll provide more detailed instructions in the later sections. 
You can also refer to the ReactGenie documentation for additional guidance.

In the following section, we'll demonstrate how to implement a simple Counter App with ReactGenie.
Due to our focus on the functionalities supported by the application in this experiment, 
we will only cover state code related details.
<font color="red">In this experiments, you will only need to modify the state code of the app and not be concerned with other parts.</font>

### 1.2 Environment Check
Open WebStorm, we have prepared a starter project for you called <font color="red">`Counter`</font>

The tutorial below will guide how to construct a new Counter using this starter project.
To run the starter ReactGenie project, you can use the following commands:

```bash copy
npm install 
npx expo start --web 
```

Note that the ReactGenie framework provides a microphone button on the bottom right of the webpage. Users can click this button 
to utilize the React Genie voice interface when they would like to. Users can also continue to use the graphical user interface (GUI) as 
they please.

### 1.3 State Code

#### 1.3.1 Create state classes

ReactGenie provides you with two inbuilt classes that you can extend from for your state classes.
1. **DataClass**: A DataClass is the basic unit for data management, and an instance of a DataClass can be viewed as a record in a database. 
The property in a DataClass can be a number, string, boolean, list, DataClass, or a HelperClass. Read more in the [docs](https://react-genie-developer-study.vercel.app/geniedoc/decorators#dataclass).
2. **HelperClass**: The HelperClass stores and manages complex data types. They will be used to define complex properties in a Dataclass, so that they can be serialized and deserialized. Read more in the [docs](https://react-genie-developer-study.vercel.app/geniedoc/decorators#helperclass).

Note: **You don't need to create any HelperClass in the Counter app.** 
{/* However,
you will need to use predefined HelperClass (i.e., <font color="red">`TimeDelta`</font>) while building Timer for creating complex properties in your DataClass. */}

Let's get started with implementing a Counter Dataclass to store and manage our Counters!

Initialize the file <font color="red">`Counter.ts`</font> under the <font color="red">`genie`</font> folder:
```bash
-genie
    -Counter.ts
```

To create a DataClass, you need to define all the properties of the DataClass in primitive types (e.g., <font color="red">`string`</font>, <font color="red">`int`</font>,
<font color="red">`boolean`</font>), arrays of primitive types, compound types using HelperClass, or arrays of compount types.

```typescript filename="Counter.ts" 
import { GenieClass, DataClass, int } from "reactgenie-lib";

export class Counter extends DataClass{
    public name: string;
    public type: string;
    public count: int;
    public created: boolean;
}
```

Now we're introducing a key concept in ReactGenie, the **ReactGenie decorators**.
ReactGenie can transform users' natural language queries to function calls.
To achieve this, you need to add a ReactGenie decorator for the classes, functions, and properties that you want the users to be able to access with multimodal interactions (voice + touch).
In the decorator, <font color="red">you can **optionally** specify a string to describe the purpose of the class, function, or property.</font>
The description you provided in the decorator will be passed to LLM to help ReactGenie understand it.


```typescript filename="Counter.ts" {3, 5, 7, 9, 11}
import { GenieClass, DataClass, GenieProperty, int } from "reactgenie-lib";

@GenieClass("A counter example")
export class Counter extends DataClass{
    @GenieProperty("The name of object that you want to count")
    public name: string;
    @GenieProperty("The type of objects (vegetable, fruit, ...)")
    public type: string;
    @GenieProperty() // You can omit the description
    public count: int;
    @GenieProperty() // You can omit the description
    public created: boolean;
}
```

This class is still missing one important piece. Each <font color="red">`DataClass`</font> requires a key to
help ReactGenie manage the classes. The key has to be unique for each instance of the class.
In ReactGenie, this is done through annotating the key property with a <font color="red">`@GenieKey`</font> decorator.
Let's add this to our class:


```typescript filename="Counter.ts" {5,6}
import { GenieClass, DataClass, GenieKey, GenieProperty, int } from "reactgenie-lib";

@GenieClass("A counter example")
export class Counter extends DataClass{
    @GenieKey
    public id: string;

    @GenieProperty("The name of object that you want to count")
    public name: string;
    @GenieProperty("The type of objects (vegetable, fruit, ...)")
    public type: string;
    @GenieProperty() // You can omit the description
    public count: int;
    @GenieProperty() // You can omit the description
    public created: boolean;
}
```

To recap, a state class (<font color="red">`DataClass`</font>) in ReactGenie requires three types of decorators:
* <font color="red">`@GenieClass("{description of the class}")`</font> that extends <font color="red">`DataClass`</font>
* <font color="red">`@GenieProperty("{description of the property}")`</font>: properties that you want to expose to ReactGenie
* <font color="red">`@GenieKey`</font>: a unique key for each instance of the class

#### 1.3.2 State class management

Now that we've defined our properties, we need to initialize these properties using a constructor. This is required for all the properties.

```typescript filename="Counter.ts" {17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24}
import { GenieClass, DataClass, GenieKey, GenieProperty, int } from "reactgenie-lib";

@GenieClass("A counter example")
export class Counter extends DataClass{
    @GenieKey
    public id:string;

    @GenieProperty("The name of object that you want to count")
    public name: string;
    @GenieProperty("The type of objects (vegetable, fruit, ...)")
    public type: string;
    @GenieProperty()
    public count: int;
    @GenieProperty()
    public created: boolean;

    constructor({id, name, type, count = 0, created}: {id: string, name: string, type: string, count?: int, created:boolean}) {
        super({})
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.type = type;
        this.count = count
        this.created = created;
    }
}
```


**NOTE**
You should AVOID directly calling the constructor like below:
```typescript
const counter = new Counter({id: "1", name: "apple", type: "fruit", count: 0, created: true})
```
Objects created like this will not be automatically tracked by ReactGenie.
Instead, ReactGenie provides the three static functions below to help you manage the object,
**CreateObject(), GetObject(), DeleteObject(), All()**.

<font color="red">`CreateObject()`</font> will call the constructor of the class, so **the parameters of CreateObject() is the same as constructor**.
<font color="red">`GetObject()`</font> allows you to access a object through its <font color="red">`GenieKey`</font>.
<font color="red">`All()`</font> allows you to get an array of all instances of a specific class.
<font color="red">`DeleteObject()`</font> allows you to delete a object through its <font color="red">`GenieKey`</font>.

Please use these functions to create and access the objects so that ReactGenie can track the objects. For example:
```typescript
const appleCounter = Counter.CreateObject({id: "1", name: "apple", type: "fruit", count: 0, created:true})
const getAppleCounter = Counter.GetObject({id: "1"}) // getAppleCounter === appleCounter
const allCounters = Counter.All() // allCounters === [appleCounter]
Counter.DeleteObject({id: "1"})
const allCountersAfterDelete = Counter.All() // allCountersAfterDelete === []
```

<font color="red">Note that only `All()` is automatically exposed to multimodal interactions.</font>
If you want to allow users to access other functions to handle the objects, you need to create a function and add a ReactGenie decorator for it.

For example, if we want to allow users to say "Create an apple counter", we need to create a function like:
```typescript filename="Counter.ts" {8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}
import { GenieClass, DataClass, GenieKey, GenieProperty, GenieFunction, int } from "reactgenie-lib";

@GenieClass("A counter example")
export class Counter extends DataClass{
    //...
    //...

    @GenieFunction()
    static CreateCounter({name, type, count=0, created}: 
            {name:string, type:string, count?:int, created:boolean}): Counter {
        const id = Counter.All().length.toString(); // automatically generate a unique id
        return Counter.CreateObject({id: id, name: name, type: type, count: count, created: created})
    }
}
```


#### 1.3.3 Setup placeholder objects
ReactGenie provides you with class initialization settings, where you can set static variables for the class or create placeholder objects.
The setup() function is a static function of the GenieClass. You can override the setup function for initial program
 setup and can also make it empty. ReactGenie will automatically call the function to complete the initialization.

For counter, we can set up three counters in the initialization.
```typescript filename="Counter.ts" {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
@GenieClass("A counter example")
export class Counter extends DataClass{
    //...
    static setup() {
        Counter.CreateCounter({name:"apple", type:"fruit",created:true});
        Counter.CreateCounter({name:"orange", type:"fruit", created:true});
        Counter.CreateCounter({name:"potato", type:"vegetable", created:true});
    }
}
```
#### 1.3.4 Add you own functions
Next, you can create more functionalities for your class.
For example, you can create functions to increment, decrement, and delete the counter. Don't forget to add ReactGenie decorators as these functions should be accessible to users via multimodal interactions.
```typescript filename="Counter.ts" {5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18}
@GenieClass("A counter example")
export class Counter extends DataClass{
    //...

    @GenieFunction()
    increment(): void {
        this.count = this.count + 1;
    }

    @GenieFunction()
    decrement(): void {
        this.count -= 1;
    }

    @GenieFunction()
    delete(): void {
        Counter.DeleteObject({id: this.id});
    }
}
```

Of course, you can also create functions to set names, types, etc., to support more features.
Here we get an example state code for Counter:
<details>
<summary>Counter.ts</summary>
```typescript
import {GenieClass, DataClass, GenieKey, GenieProperty, int, GenieFunction} from "reactgenie-lib";

@GenieClass("A counter example")
export class Counter extends DataClass{
    @GenieKey
    public id: string;

    @GenieProperty("The name of object that you want to count")
    public name: string;
    @GenieProperty("The type of objects (vegetable, fruit, ...)")
    public type: string;
    @GenieProperty()
    public count: int;
    @GenieProperty()
    public created: boolean;

    constructor({id, name, type, count = 0, created}:
                    {id: string, name: string, type: string, count?: int, created: boolean}) {
        super({})
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.type = type;
        this.count = count
        this.created = created;
    }

    @GenieFunction()
    static CreateCounter({name, type, count=0, created}:
                             {name: string, type: string, count?: int, created: boolean}): Counter {
        const id = Counter.All().length.toString();
        return Counter.CreateObject({id: id, name: name, type: type, count: count, created: created})
    }

    static setup() {
        Counter.CreateCounter({name: "apple", type: "fruit", created: true});
        Counter.CreateCounter({name: "orange", type: "fruit", created: true});
        Counter.CreateCounter({name: "potato", type: "vegetable", created: true});
    }

    @GenieFunction()
    increment(): void {
        this.count = this.count + 1;
    }

    @GenieFunction()
    decrement(): void {
        this.count -= 1;
    }

    @GenieFunction()
    delete(): void {
        Counter.DeleteObject({id: this.id});
    }
}
```
</details>

### 1.4 Design UI Code and Link State Code to UI

Due to the irrelevant nature of this part to the current experiment, we will skip this section. 
If you’re interested, you can visit the ReactGenie documentation (https://react-genie-developer-study.vercel.app) after the experiment to learn more.

### 1.5 Add Examples and Test
Finally, we need to add usage instances for your program to help ReactGenie correctly generate
executable results using LLM. 
We can provide examples of relevant function usage in each class. 
<font color="red">You don't need to provide examples today, but you will learn some features about ReactGenie in this part.</font>

Examples is a static list in GenieClass.
```typescript filename="Counter.ts" {3-19}
export class Counter extends GenieClass {
    //...
    static Examples = [
    {
        user_utterance: "Increse this counter",
        example_parsed: "Counter.Current().increment()",
    },
    {
        user_utterance: "show me all vegetables counters",
        example_parsed: 'Counter.All().matching(field: .type, value: "vegetable")',
    },
    {
        user_utterance: "increase me all fruit counters",
        example_parsed: 'Counter.All().matching(field: .type, value: "fruit").increment()',
    },
    {
        user_utterance: "Delete this counter",
        example_parsed: 'Counter.Current().delete()',
    }]
}
```

To help users achieve more interactions, ReactGenie supports some filtering operations on arrays.

**matching(field, value), equal(field, value)**

**between(field, from, to), sort(field, ascending)**
Note that the field passed to sort() and between() should have a static compare() function.

**contains(field, value)**
The contains() returns the member whose field value contains the given value.

All this filtering operations return a array.

For example:
```typescript
{
    user_utterance: "show me all vegetables counters",
    example_parsed: 'Counter.All().matching(field: .type, value: "vegetable")',
},
{
    user_utterance: "show me all counters less than five",
    example_parsed: 'Counter.All().between(field: .count, from: 0, to: 5)',
}
```

ReactGenie also supports some querying operations on arrays.
ReactGenie allows developers to access the properties and functions of list members during execution. 
This can be used directly to access the properties of the list members.

```typescript copy
{
    user_utterance: "Show me all counters type",
    example_parsed: 'Counter.All().type',
  },
  {
    user_utterance: "Delete all fruit counters",
    example_parsed: 'Counter.All().matching(field: .type, value: "fruit").DeleteCounter()',
  },
```
Another function is built by ReactGenie to provide rich multimodal interactions is **Current()**.
Current() is automatically created for all <font color="red">`DataClass`</font>es, and it returns the current object that is being interacted with.

We have completed a simple multimodal interactive application based on ReactGenie. Congratulations!


### 1.6 Improve Counter 
Now that you've built a simple Counter app, but it's functionalities are still limited.
For example, you can only create a counter with a specific name and type, 
and you can only increment and decrement the counter by 1.

Imagine you are a user of this app, you might want to increment or decrement the counter by a specific number.
Clearly, the current app is not enough to support this feature.

So we can add functions to support this feature.
```typescript filename="Counter.ts" 
...

@GenieFunction()
incrementBy({number}: {number: int}): void {
    this.count = this.count + number;
}

@GenieFunction()
decrementBy({number}: {number: int}): void {
    this.count -= number;
}

...

```
Besides this feature, user might have other features that they want to use.
So you need to think about the demands of user and add more functions or properties to support more features.
And that is what we will do in the following experiment.

Considering the time limit and the development cost of the possible features, you don't need to implement the functions.
You can only write some placeholders for the functions.
For example, you can write an empty function to support the feature of incrementing the counter by a specific number.
```typescript filename="Counter.ts"
@GenieFunction()
incrementBy({number}: {number: int}): void {
    //to be implemented
}
```
<font color="red">You only need to focus on what kind of features you want to support instead of the implementation details.</font>
Let move on to the next part to start the experiment.
