## 2. GenieWizard
GenieWizard is a vscode plugin that supports the development of multimodal applications. 
It can help you uncover the functionality of multimodal applications to support user input. 
GenieWizard will simulate interaction between multiple users and the existing application, 
providing you with functionality that users attempt to use, 
but is currently not supported by the application. Additionally, 
GenieWizard will track the frequency of usage for the missing functionality to provide you with insights into the importance of each feature.


We have prepared screenshots for you to help you understand how to use GenieWizard plugin.

When you click on the Generate Description button, 
GenieWizard will generate a description for your app based on your current code. 
This description will be filled in the “description” field of the `package.json` file.
You can also manually edit the description in the `package.json` file.

Once you have the app description, you can click on the Generate Suggestion button. 
GenieWizard will generate suggestions for your app based on the description. 
These suggestions will be displayed in the sidebar of GenieWizard.
<img style={{display:"inline-block"}} src="/Suggestions.png" width="45%"/>
<img style={{display:"inline-block"}} src="/Details.png" width="45%"/>

You can explore the suggested functions by selecting them, and see the supported interactions that implementing each function will provide.
Each suggestion provides specific interaction details to help you understand the purpose of the suggestion.

You can try to hover your cursor above the suggestion to see the details of the suggestion and check the feature that you want to implement.
Everytime you modify the code, the suggestion related to the selected features will be updated.
"√" for successfully implemented features, "-" for not implemented features, "!" for features that requires more functions or properties.

You only need to determain which feature you want to implement.
