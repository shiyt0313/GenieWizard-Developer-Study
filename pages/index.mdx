# Welcome

Welcome to the GenieWizard Developer Study!

**Please think aloud a little bit during the tasks.
You can just try to verbalize your thoughts so we can better understanding how you approach the task.**

When multimodal interaction is introduced into applications, 
usersâ€™ input information becomes diverse, which presents challenges for the functionality of the application itself. 
Today, you will be improving two multimodal applications built with the ReactGenie framework. 
We have prepared detailed instructions and documentation to assist you along the way.

We first put together a tutorial to help you learn ReactGenie. 
In the tutorial, we will show you how to build and improve a simple Counter app.

The experiment task will be divided into two parts. 

In the first part, 
you will improve the application based on <font color="red">**your own thinking and the expected use of the application**</font>. 
In this process, you can modify the functionality based on your development experience or understanding of the application, 
with **the goal of supporting as many possible multimodal inputs from users**.

In the second part, 
you will use a <font color="red">**multi-modal application development tool, GenieWizard**</font>, to improve the multi-modal application. 
We will provide a detailed introduction to the features and usage of GenieWizard in the next section.


In the task section, you need to improve two apps:  **Menu** and **Hotel Booking**.
<font color="red">**You don't need to actually implement specific functionality,
you just need to create the placeholder for property or function as required.**</font>
Please refer to the Counter app we used in the tutorial as a reference to think about how to improve a multimodal app.

We have also provided documentation for ReactGenie that you can consult for specific features of ReactGenie.

Please proceed to the **Instructions** section when you are ready to start the study!
